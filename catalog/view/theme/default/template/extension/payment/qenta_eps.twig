Shop System Plugins - Terms of Use

The plugins offered are provided free of charge by QENTA Payment CEE GmbH
(abbreviated to QENTA) and are explicitly not part of the QENTA range of
products and services.

They have been tested and approved for full functionality in the standard
configuration
(status on delivery) of the corresponding shop system. They are under
General Public License Version 2 (GPLv2) and can be used, developed and
passed on to third parties under the same terms.

However, QENTA does not provide any guarantee or accept any liability
for any errors occurring when used in an enhanced, customized shop system
configuration.

Operation in an enhanced, customized configuration is at your own risk and
requires a comprehensive test phase by the user of the plugin.

Customers use the plugins at their own risk. QENTA does not guarantee
their full functionality neither does QENTA assume liability for any
disadvantages related to the use of the plugins. Additionally, QENTA
does not guarantee the full functionality for customized shop systems or
installed plugins of other vendors of plugins within the same shop system.

Customers are responsible for testing the plugin's functionality before
starting productive operation.

By installing the plugin into the shop system the customer agrees to these
terms of use. Please do not use the plugin if you do not agree to these
terms of use!
