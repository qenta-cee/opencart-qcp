 * Operation in an enhanced, customized configuration is at your own risk and
 * requires a comprehensive test phase by the user of the plugin.
 *
 * Customers use the plugins at their own risk. Wirecard CEE does not guarantee
 * their full functionality neither does Wirecard CEE assume liability for any
 * disadvantages related to the use of the plugins. Additionally, Wirecard CEE
 * does not guarantee the full functionality for customized shop systems or
 * installed plugins of other vendors of plugins within the same shop system.
 *
 * Customers are responsible for testing the plugin's functionality before
 * starting productive operation.
 *
 * By installing the plugin into the shop system the customer agrees to these
